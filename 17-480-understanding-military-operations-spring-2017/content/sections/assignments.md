Students will be required to write one 20â€“30 page research paper that delves more deeply into one or several warfare areas and asks how doctrine influences the development and use of different weapon or sensor technologies. Papers will employ the case study method and topics can be based on historic, current, or future cases. It is required that the topic be approved by the Instructor.

Sample topics include:

*   a comparison of alternative methods for organizing military space activity
*   a comparison of both the doctrine and technology of cruise missile development in the U.S. and the USSR during the Cold War
*   an analysis of the U.S. Air Force versus the Military Reform Movement debate over the future of air combat after Vietnam
